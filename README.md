Bitcoin artwork

20241202T202145Z: Created this repository as a way to prove that I was the creator of the bitcoin art that I have produced.  It would be provable in the sense that the first place they've appeared online anywhere was when I added them to this repository.  The images were produced by various generative AIs with prompts that I have used.  I usually generate the images, enhance the quality, and add a barely noticeable watermark.
