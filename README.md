Bitcoin artwork

20241202T202145Z: Created this repository as a way to prove that I was the creator of the bitcoin art that I have produced.  It would be provable in the sense that the first place they've appeared online anywhere was when I added them to this repository.  The images were produced by various generative AIs with prompts that I have used.  I usually generate the images, enhance the quality, and add a barely noticeable watermark.

20241202T202816Z: Scratch the idea of using github to host the images.  The first one that I tried to upload said it was over the allowed filesize.  It let me upload a JPG, but not PNG.  The PNG has been uploaded to https://cdn.satellite.earth/d01119928ea8fab340923b4c483c5ccd1df1bf3d60e5a8c9d93451bca8a36ff1.png
